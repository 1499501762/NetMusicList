QUICK START - NetMusicList Build Guide
========================================

BEFORE YOU BUILD - Download NetMusic Dependency
------------------------------------------------

This project requires NetMusic as a compile dependency.

1. Open in browser:
   https://modrinth.com/mod/net-music/versions (author: TartaricAcid)

2. Find and click:
   Version "1.2.1 for Fabric 1.21.1"

3. Click "Download" button

4. Move the downloaded jar file to:
   D:\Dev\NetMusicList\libs\

5. Verify the file exists:
   libs\net-music-1.2.1-fabric+mc1.21.1.jar (or equivalent filename containing 1.2.1 and Fabric 1.21.1)

Alternative Download Sources:

BUILD THE PROJECT
-----------------

After placing NetMusic jar in libs/:

.\gradlew.bat build

The build output will be in:
build\libs\


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

If you see "NetMusic dependency not found":
→ Make sure you placed the jar file in libs/ directory

If build fails with compilation errors:
→ Make sure you downloaded the Fabric version (not Forge)
→ Make sure the version is 1.2.1 for Minecraft 1.21.1

If Gradle fails to download other dependencies:
→ Check your internet connection
→ If behind a proxy, configure gradle.properties
